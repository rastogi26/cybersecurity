# Apply Filters to SQL Queries

## Project Description

My organization is working to make their system more secure. It is my job to ensure the system is safe, investigate all potential security issues, and update employee computers as needed. The following steps provide examples of how I used SQL with filters to perform security-related tasks.

### Retrieve After Hours Failed Login Attempts

There was a potential security incident that occurred after business hours (after 18:00). All after hours login attempts that failed need to be investigated.

The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for failed login attempts that occurred after business hours:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > '18:00' AND success = FALSE;
```

### Retrieve Login Attempts on Specific Dates

A suspicious event occurred on 2022-05-09. Any login activity that happened on 2022-05-09 or on the day before needs to be investigated.

The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for login attempts that occurred on specific dates:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_date = '2022-05-09' OR login_date = '2022-05-08';
```

### Retrieve Login Attempts Outside of Mexico

After investigating the organizationâ€™s data on login attempts, I believe there is an issue with the login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. These login attempts should be investigated.

The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE NOT country LIKE 'MEX%';
```

### Retrieve Employees in Marketing

My team wants to update the computers for certain employees in the Marketing department. To do this, I have to get information on which employee machines to update.

The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for employee machines from employees in the Marketing department in the East building:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Marketing' AND office LIKE 'East%';
```

### Retrieve Employees in Finance or Sales

The machines for employees in the Finance and Sales departments also need to be updated. Since a different security update is needed, I have to get information on employees only from these two departments.

The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for employee machines from employees in the Finance or Sales departments:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Finance' OR department = 'Sales';
```

### Retrieve All Employees Not in IT
My team needs to make one more security update on employees who are not in the Information Technology department. To make the update, I first have to get information on these employees.

The following demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for employee machines from employees not in the Information Technology department:

```sql
Copy code
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE NOT department = 'IT';
```
### Summary
I applied filters to SQL queries to get specific information on login attempts and employee machines. I used two different tables, log_in_attempts and employees. I used the AND, OR, and NOT operators to filter for the specific information needed for each task. I also used LIKE and the percentage sign (%) wildcard to filter for patterns.
